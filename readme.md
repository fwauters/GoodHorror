# Good Horror !

:construction: **The project is in progress !**

:construction: **App not hosted yet !**

## Concept

Welcome in Good Horror ! This is a web app that index my favorite horror movies.

I had this idea from an inside-joke, because horror films are not necessarily bad.

In time I may add reviews, recommendations and stuff like that but it's still a work in progress.

## Content

For now the content is limited to a few movies that I like with some basic infos, but more's coming soon.

## Context

This is an exercise I started for my formation with [BeCode](https://becode.org/) to practice making a customized WordPress theme, but as I learned I had the idea to make a theme for my horror app concept.

### Technos

- WordPress
- HTML / PHP
- CSS / Bootstrap
