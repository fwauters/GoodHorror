# Good Horror !

:construction: **This project is a work in progress !**

You can check my advancement on my website [@fwauters.be/en/good-horor](http://fwauters.be/en/good-horror).

## Concept

Welcome in Good Horror ! This is a web app that index my favorite horror movies. :skull:

I had this idea from an inside-joke, because I love horror films and some of my friends say that all thoses movies are bad. Hence my choice of slogan: "Because horror films are not necessarily bad". :grin:

In time I may add reviews, recommendations and stuff like that but it's still a work in progress.

## Content

For now the content is limited to a few movies that I like with some basic infos, but more's coming soon.

## Context

This is an exercise I started for my formation with [BeCode](https://becode.org/) to practice making a customized WordPress theme, but as I learned I had the idea to make a theme for my horror app concept.
